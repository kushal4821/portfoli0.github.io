// Train Management System : A Simulation of Train Scheduling, Movement, and Safety
// This system simulates the management of trains operating on a railway network,
// with features such as scheduling, route management, safety mechanisms, and real - time tracking.
// # 1. Purpose : The train management system's primary goal is to ensure efficient scheduling and safe operation of trains.
// # 2. It facilitates real - time monitoring of trains, schedules, and track utilization.
// # 3. The system aims to optimize train schedules to prevent delays, reduce congestion, and maintain safety.
// #Initialization of Train Schedules and Routes
// # 4. The system initializes a schedule for each train, including departure times, destinations, and intermediate stops.
// # 5. Routes for trains are predefined, with tracks assigned to specific trains to avoid conflicts.
// # 6. The system checks available tracks and schedules to ensure that no two trains are scheduled to use the same track at the same time.
// #Train Movement Simulation

// # 7. The system simulates the movement of trains based on real - time speed and location data.
// # 8. It ensures that trains follow their designated route, stopping at specific stations or checkpoints.
// # 9. Train movement is tracked continuously using GPS data, sensors, or other location - tracking technologies.
// #Scheduling and Route Optimization
// # 10. The system dynamically adjusts train schedules to minimize delays and prevent conflicts between trains.
// # 11. It accounts for factors like track availability, train speed, and scheduled stops to optimize the flow of trains.
// # 12. During peak hours, the system prioritizes faster or more important routes to reduce congestion.
// #Conflict Avoidance and Track Allocation
// #/ 13. The system ensures no two trains are on the same track segment at the same time, preventing collisions.
// # 14. It uses a conflict resolution algorithm to reroute trains if there are any track conflicts or maintenance issues.
// # 15. When a track is blocked(e.g., due to a stalled train), the system reroutes other trains, maintaining minimal disruption.
// #Data Logging and Reporting
// # 32. The system logs all train movements, including arrival times, delays, and track usage.
// # 33. Historical data is used to analyze trends, optimize scheduling, and identify areas for improvement.
// # 34. Monthly and annual reports provide insights into system performance, operational efficiency, and train punctuality.
// #Maintenance and Track Monitoring
// # 35. The system includes functionality for scheduling routine maintenance on trains and tracks.
// # 36. It tracks the condition of trains and infrastructure, scheduling repairs or inspections when needed.
// # 37. Maintenance alerts are generated when certain thresholds(e.g., mileage or system status) are met.

// #Coordination Between Multiple Train Stations
// # 38. The system coordinates operations across multiple stations, ensuring that arriving and departing trains do not conflict.
// # 39. It synchronizes train schedules across regions, allowing for smooth transfers between different parts of the network.
// # 40. It ensures that connecting trains wait for delayed passengers or cargo, where applicable, to prevent missed connections.
// #Performance Evaluation and Feedback
// # 41. The system evaluates performance based on train punctuality, passenger satisfaction, and efficiency metrics.
// # 42. Feedback from train operators, passengers, and stakeholders is gathered to make improvements to the system.
// # 43. Regular evaluations are used to identify areas where delays occur most frequently and make changes to prevent them.
// #User Interface and Visualization
// # 44. The system provides a dashboard for train operators and controllers to visualize train locations, track occupancy, and schedules.
// # 45. The interface includes features for monitoring train status in real - time, sending alerts, and adjusting schedules dynamically.
// # 46. Passenger - facing interfaces include mobile apps or station displays showing live updates on train arrivals, delays, and platform assignments.
// #Fault Detection and Error Handling
// # 47. The system continuously monitors its own performance and identifies potential faults or errors, such as broken signals or communication failures.
// # 48. In the event of a fault, the system generates error reports and triggers backup systems to ensure smooth operation.
// # 49. It can handle temporary track outages or train failures by rerouting trains, rescheduling, or providing alternative transportation options.
// #Future Enhancements
// # 50. Future improvements to the system may include the integration of AI for predictive maintenance, autonomous trains, and better congestion management algorithms.
